M-STATS: framework for frequentist statistical analysis 
=======================================================

This software package provides libraries for implementing and solving
statistical problems with focus on frequentist techniques


Installation
------------

To install, run

     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure [--prefix=/path/to/custom/dir]
     make [-jN] install

Note: by default, 'make install' will install all the files in
'/usr/local/bin', '/usr/local/lib', etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' using:

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/custom/dir


Running the code
----------------
If the installation dir is not already in the default list of your system, you
need to export some env variables (example for bash):

export PREFIX=/path/to/custom/dir
export PATH=$MYPREFIX/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MYPREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export CPATH="$MYPREFIX/include:$CPATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$MYPREFIX2/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"



Code documentation
------------------
All code is commented by using doxygen notation and documentation in html.
To create, run

   doxygen doc/

Browse the html starting from doc/html/index.html, i.e. run

   firefox doc/html/index.html
